## Description

This is a repository dedicated to solving problems using Javascript. The solution provided are for the three challenges.

# Challenge 1 : The swapCase

Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.
This function accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example the input will be 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.
We can solve this by having a function that will check whether the character is lowerCase if so, then it should convert to uppercase. If it is in upperCase then convert to lowerCase. Convert the character into a result string. Return the final string with swapped case.

# Challenge 2: The generateArray

This is a function called generateArrayBetween, that will take two numbers the start and end as input and creates an array containing all integers between them. It will handle both the ascending and descending order based on the relationship between start and end.
Introduce a for loop that will check both the step value and the comparison i and end to ensure correct value based with the ascending and descending order.

# Challenge 3: primeNumbers.js

You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. How would you implement this function efficiently, ensuring that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array? For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
Write a function that will identify prime numbers within an array of numbers. The input will take a single argument which is an array of numbers. Then will give an output that shall return a new array containing only prime numbers from the input array (primes)
